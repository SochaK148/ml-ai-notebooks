# ML & AI Notebooks

Welcome to `ml-ai-notebooks` - a repository dedicated to sharing my learning journey through the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This collection of Jupyter notebooks is a testament to the hands-on approach I've taken to understand and implement various concepts and algorithms in ML and AI using Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow 2 (Keras).

Each notebook in this repository is structured to not only demonstrate coding skills but also to document the reasoning, theoretical understanding, and decision-making process behind each step. All notebooks were created in Google Colab for a seamless and interactive learning experience.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Machine Learning Spam Classifier
**[`01_ml_spam_classifier.ipynb`](./01_ml_spam_classifier.ipynb)**
- A machine learning application to predict whether an email is spam.
- Covers concepts from data preprocessing, feature engineering to model evaluation.
- Demonstrates practical applications of `GridSearchCV`, `RandomizedSearchCV`, and custom transformers.

### 2. Gradient Descent, SVMs, Decision Trees
**[`02_ml_gradient_svm_trees.ipynb`](./02_ml_gradient_svm_trees.ipynb.ipynb)**
- Explores three pivotal machine learning techniques: Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.
- Emphasizes hands-on modeling, optimization, and evaluation across diverse datasets.

### 3. Ensemble Learning on Modified MNIST with Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
**[`03_ml_mnist_olivetti.ipynb.ipynb`](./03_ml_mnist_olivetti.ipynb)**
- Trains various classifiers on modified versions of the MNIST dataset.
- Uses ensemble methods to boost classification performance.
- Implements dimensionality reduction for faster training and effective visualization.
- Explores clustering techniques on the Olivetti face dataset.
